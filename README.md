In this project, we worked on health monitoriting system which keeps track of
diseases present in the society. It helps people with their appointments with the
hospital. People can gain knowledge about the diseases present in society. It can
help create awareness in the government and also people towards the health
issues the present society is facing.
Based on this, the government can be able to decide on which medicines they
can spend the resources on.
Visualization was also done for people to easily understand about the disease
